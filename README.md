# FOODini

My first project. App for planning meals, preventing food waste and shopping list automation.

DEMO: a link will be here later

## Things i plan to learn

- Project planning
- Creating Flowcharts
- API Uploads
- Error handling
- MVC architecture

## Things i learned but didn't plan to

- CSS: BEM naming system (css gets messy very quickly)
- CSS: styling complex things is more difficult than i thought
- JS: To remove eventListener with .bind() method on it, the listener has to be assigned to a variable (EXAMPLE: handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this) )
